<p><strong>&ldquo;Music is a window to a different, spiritual world; a bridge that brings us out of the everyday and joins us with the experience.&rdquo;</strong>
(Guntars Gudelis)</p>

<p>The composer, conductor, singer, teacher and active Latvian community member Guntars Gedulis was born on August 27th, 1952 in New York, the United States. His first musical impressions were received from his father, singer Visvaldis Gedulis. From an early age he learned to play the piano, later clarinet, performing in school orchestras.
